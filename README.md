# Task Tracker CLI

Task Tracker CLI is a command-line application that helps you track and manage your to-do list. With this tool, you can add, update, delete, and list tasks, as well as mark them as "in-progress" or "done." The application stores all tasks in a JSON file.

## Task Properties

Each task in the Task Tracker CLI has the following properties:
- **id**: A unique identifier for the task.
- **description**: A brief description of the task.
- **status**: The current status of the task (`todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`).
- **createdAt**: The date and time when the task was created.
- **updatedAt**: The date and time when the task was last updated.

These properties are saved in `tasks.json` and are updated automatically as you modify tasks.
